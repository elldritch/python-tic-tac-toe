# Tic-tac-toe
This is a simple command-line implementation of tic-tac-toe in Python, intended to be used as an educational tool for implementing graph search and alpha-beta AI.

## Usage
Clone the repository, then run `python3 play.py <game-type>` to run a game, where `<game-type>` is of the form `AvB` to determine the game's players. Use `P` for human players, `D` for the dumb computer player (which picks a move at random), and `S` for the smart computer player, whose implementation is left as an exercise for the reader.
